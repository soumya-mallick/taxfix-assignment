Code files:
 1. schema_validator.py - contains code for json schema validation.
 2. report.py - contains code to generate the report.

# Note: 
1. I have used my system directories as working directory for the docker. Please update this.
2. The validation log file and the report(saved in .png) format get stored in the directory where the code is getting executed.
