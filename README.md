## Code files:
 1. schema_validator.py - contains code for json schema validation.
 2. report.py - contains code to generate the report.

## Note: 
1. I have used my local system directory as working directory. Please update the directories in the "dockerfile" appropriately.
2. The validation log file and the report(saved in .png) format get stored in the directory where the code is getting executed.
